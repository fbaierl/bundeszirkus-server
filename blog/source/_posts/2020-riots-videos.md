A small compilation of the 2020 riots after George Floyds death.

The protests and riots began in Minneapolis on May 26, 2020, following the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes during an arrest the previous day.
